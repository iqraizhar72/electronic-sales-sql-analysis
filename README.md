<h2>Objectives</h2>
<br>
<h4>1. Set up a Electronics sales database:</h4><br> Create and populate a Electronics sales database with the sales data provided.
<br>
<h4>2. Data Cleaning:</h4><br>Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.
<br>
<h4>3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</h4><br>Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
<br>
<h4>4. Business Analysis:</h4><br>Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive insights from the sales data.
<br>
<h2>Project Structure</h2>
<br>
<h3>1. Database Setup</h3>
