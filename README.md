# Electronics Sales Analysis
A SQL-based data analysis project of electronic product sales from 2023 and 2024. Includes database creation, data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and business insights using advanced SQL queries.
<br>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<br>
<h4>1. Set up a Electronics sales database:</h4>Create and populate a Electronics sales database with the sales data provided.
<br>
<h4>2. Data Cleaning:</h4>Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.
<br>
<h4>3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</h4>Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
<br>
<h4>4. Business Analysis:</h4>Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive insights from the sales data.
<br>
<h2>Project Structure</h2>
<br>
<h3>1. Database Setup</h3>
<br>
<h4>Database Creation:</h4>The project starts by creating a database named ELECTRONICS_SALES.
<br>
<h4>Table Creation:</h4>Two tables named sales_2023,sales_2024 is created to store the sales data of 2 years.
<br>
The both tables structure includes columns for
<br>
product_id
<br>
product_name
<br>
category
<br>
brand
<br>
customer_ID
<br>
customer_name
<br>
sale_date
<br>
sale_amount
<br>
sale_quantity
<br>
discount
<br>
payment_method
<br>
region
<br>
store
<br>
profit
<br>
<h3>2. Data Exploration & Cleaning</h3>
<br>
<h4>• Record Count:</h4>Determine the total number of records in the dataset.
<br>
<h4>• Customer Count:</h4>Find out how many unique customers are in the dataset.
<br>
<h4>• Category Count:</h4>Identify all unique product categories in the dataset.
<br>
<h4>• Null Value Check:</h4><Check for any null values in the dataset and delete records with missing data.
<br>
<h3>3. Data Analysis & Findings</h3>
<br> 
<br>
1. Retrieve all sales records from 2023 and 2024 combined.
2. Find the total profit for each table.
3. Find the total sales amount for each table.
4. Calculate the total sales quantity for each product brand.
5. List all unique product categories in the dataset.
6. Identify the payment methods used and the count of transactions for each.
7. Find the average sales amount and total sales quantity for each region.
8. Calculate the maximum discount offered in both years.
9. Determine the product with the highest sales quantity in 2023.
10. Compare the total sales amount between 2023 and 2024 for each category.
11. List the top 3 stores with the highest total sales in 2024.
12. Retrieve sales records where the discount is greater than 10%.
13. Find regions where the average sales amount exceeds 500.
14. Get a list of categories with total sales greater than 1000, grouped by year.
15. Identify products sold in more than three regions.
16. Retrieve customers with total sales of over 1000, using HAVING.
17. List sales records from 2024 that occurred in the first quarter (Jan–Mar).
18. Find the monthly sales trends for both years:
19. Calculate the total sales for each year grouped by quarters:
20. Identify the days with the highest sales amount in each year:
21. Compare the total sales for the same month in 2023 and 2024:
22. Combine data from both tables and list the total sales for each product:
23. Find customers who made purchases in both years:
24. Identify products that were sold in 2023 but not in 2024:
25. Retrieve the details of stores that had sales in both years:
26. Create a union of both tables and list the distinct products sold:
27. Use DISTINCT to find unique customer names across both years:
28. Use CASE to classify sales as "High", "Medium", or "Low" based on the sales amount:
29. Use LIMIT or TOP to fetch the top 10 customers by total sales amount:
30. List all customers who purchased only in 2023 but not in 2024.
