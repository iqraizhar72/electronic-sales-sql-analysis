# üìä SQL Project: Electronics Sales Analysis

## üìù Objectives

1. **Database Setup**  
   Create and populate an electronics sales database using sales data from 2023 and 2024.

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   Identify and remove records with missing or null values.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Perform preliminary analysis to understand key metrics and structure of the data.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

### 1. üì¶ Database Setup

- **Database Creation**
```sql
CREATE DATABASE electronics_sales;
Table Creation
Two tables: sales_2023 and sales_2024, structured as follows:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE sales_2023 (
  sale_ID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  product_id INT NOT NULL,
  product_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  category VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  brand VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  customer_ID INT NOT NULL,
  customer_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  sale_date DATE NOT NULL,
  sale_amount INT NOT NULL,
  sale_quantity INT DEFAULT 1 NOT NULL,
  discount INT NOT NULL,
  payment_method VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  region VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  store VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  profit INT NOT NULL
);
-- Same structure for sales_2024
2. üßπ Data Exploration & Cleaning
Record Count

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sales_2023;
Unique Customers

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_ID) FROM sales_2023;
Category Count

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT category) FROM sales_2023;
Null Value Check and Deletion

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM sales_2023
WHERE product_id IS NULL OR product_name IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR brand IS NULL
  OR customer_ID IS NULL OR customer_name IS NULL OR sale_date IS NULL
  OR sale_amount IS NULL OR sale_quantity IS NULL OR discount IS NULL
  OR payment_method IS NULL OR region IS NULL OR store IS NULL OR profit IS NULL;

DELETE FROM sales_2023
WHERE [same conditions as above];
-- Repeat for sales_2024
3. üìä Data Analysis & Insights
The following SQL queries address 30 business-focused questions using the data:

üìå Sample Questions:
Combine sales data from 2023 and 2024

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM sales_2023
UNION
SELECT * FROM sales_2024;
Total profit and sales amount by year

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT SUM(profit) FROM sales_2023;
SELECT SUM(sale_amount) FROM sales_2023;
-- Repeat for sales_2024
Sales quantity by brand

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT brand, SUM(sale_quantity) FROM sales_2023 GROUP BY brand;
Top-selling product

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT product_name, SUM(sale_quantity)
FROM sales_2023
GROUP BY product_name
ORDER BY SUM(sale_quantity) DESC
LIMIT 1;
Sales trends, regions, stores, and customers analysis
Includes:

Monthly and quarterly breakdowns

Regional sales performance

Top 10 customers

High/medium/low sales classification

Customers active in both years or only one

‚úîÔ∏è All 30 queries are well-structured and use core SQL concepts: JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING, CASE, UNION, LIMIT.
