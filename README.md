# electronic-sales-sql-analysis
A SQL-based data analysis project of electronic product sales from 2023 and 2024. Includes database creation, data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and business insights using advanced SQL queries.
<br>
<br>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<br>
1. Set up a Electronics sales database:<br> Create and populate a Electronics sales database with the sales data provided.
<br>
<br>
2. Data Cleaning:<br>Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.
<br>
<br>
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):<br>Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
<br>
<br>
4. Business Analysis:<br>Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive insights from the sales data.
<br>
<br>
<h2>Project Structure</h2>
<br>
<br>
<h3>1. Database Setup</h3>
<br>
<br>
Database Creation:<br>The project starts by creating a database named ELECTRONICS_SALES.
